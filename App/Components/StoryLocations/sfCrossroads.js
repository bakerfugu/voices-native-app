      transcript: `I'm glad you're checking out Crossroads. If you're interested in sustainable fashion through thrifting, San Francisco is a great place to be. Crossroads Trading is one of the many awesome thrift shops in San Francisco. Known for its high quality gently used current and vintage fashion, Crossroads always has fantastic finds. The last time I was at Crossroads I got a pair of black heels that I constantly get compliments on, and my the friend I was with got a super cute denim jacket. I highly recommend stepping into Crossroads and exploring all it has to offer. There are also locations in other cities and states in the US. Itâ€™s fun to see how resale fashion changes based on the quirks of your location!`

      transcript: `For as long I can remember I have always been into fashion. As a little girl I was automatically drawn to any woman who I perceived as dressing well. Sounds superficial right? But for me it wasn't superficial at all. Being raised by a single mother meant not getting everything I wanted. Only what I actually needed. So, as a child I wasn't spoiled by any means. However, growing up I did notice that people who dressed well seemed to get more respect. Almost like they were magical. Not only I, but others seemed to be drawn to them as well. Having observed that in my most impressionable years formed how I would decide to present myself to other people later in my life. Thrifting for me started as soon as I was able to get an allowance of any sort. I would even save my lunch money and eat less just so I would have enough money by the end of the week to go thrifting at the Goodwill down the street from my house. My sister and I would do a few extra chores to get a couple more bucks and off we would go down the street to shop. We would literally have $5 to $6 in our hand but we somehow would ALWAYS manage to come back with a large bag full of treasures. Our parents were always surprised at exactly how much we were able to get. When I realized I could look just as put together as the kids around me by spending way less, that frugal nature stuck and I took that with me into my adulthood. `,
