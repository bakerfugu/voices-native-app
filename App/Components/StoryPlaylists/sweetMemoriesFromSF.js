        transcript: `If you’re here in May you might get a chance to see or, if you plan right, to participate in Bay to Breakers. Bay to Breakers is a tradition that screams San Francisco! It has been going on for over 100 years.  This is a 12k like no other. People walk, jog, and dance from Embarcadero to Ocean Beach dressed in wacky costumes. You’ll see groups ranging from the whole game of thrones cast to pac men to donuts. It is a wonderful way to see how San Francisco celebrates life, individuality, and culture!`,

        transcript: `One of my favorite memories of San Francisco was at Hippie Hill, which has a bunch of swings that overlook San Francisco. You can see the entire bay. You have to go across the golden gate bridge to be able to access it and it is a 1 mile hike up. But once you get there, there are three or four different swings you can swing on. You can take so many different photos. There’s also a really cool tree you can climb up to get an even better view of the San Francisco Bay. `,

        transcript: `Smitten ice cream isn’t just incredibly tasty— it is an engineering marvel! All of the ice cream is made with the patented ‘Brrr’ machine. The founder of Smitten worked with a team of 14 engineers to create the Brrr machine.  Using a combination of liquid nitrogen and double helical beaters, the Brr machine creates ice cream with the ideal texture, viscosity, and richness. Although you can go to Smitten’s permanent locations in PacHeights, Hayes Valley, Santana Row, and Rockridge, Smitten started out as just the Brr machine on a radio flyer wagon. The founder Robyn Fisher made Smitten a household name, charting her wagon all over the iconic places of SF. Now you can order ice cream from Brrrristas that will be the smoothest, richest ice cream in the bay. I truly cannot live without the cookie dough ice cream with pretzels and chocolate chips. Go try some!`,

        transcript: `Some of my favorite times in SF that I can remember was this one time for national ice cream day my friend organized this whole ice cream tour around SF. We visited 4 or 5 ice cream stops. I can’t remember the first one but the other three were Smitten ice cream, which was absolutely delicious, then we went to Loving Cup in SF which is frozen yogurt but it is like Cold Stone version so that was really good. It was really sweet overall, but it was still really delicious. And then the last one we went to was the Baked Bear which was one of my favorites. After we had the ice cream we went right into China Town and Little Italy because it is right in the heart of it. So we were able to have this delicious food and walk around all across SF while having ice cream which is pretty much a perfect day in my opinion. The only downside was there are just so many hills in SF. So we got tired and had to get coffee to sustain us.`,

        transcript: `Nothing screams childhood memories more to me than Smitten Ice Cream. Smitten Ice cream isn’t just any old ice cream shop.When people tell me, “oh yeah, I know about Smitten Ice Cream, it’s like my neighborhood ice cream shop”, I get really offended. Smitten Ice Cream is special more than just about the ice cream it serves or who comes to visit it. But rather its founder, she stands for something bigger and better. `
