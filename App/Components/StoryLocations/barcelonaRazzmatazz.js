      transcript: `It is no secret that Barcelona has amazing nightlife. When you’re here at night you can follow the sound of music to world renowned clubs that famous DJs have played at. My personal favorite place to dance the night away is Razzmatazz.  You can lose track of time and have a ball there, but don’t show up before 1am because that is when the action really starts.`

They gave me a platform to share my love for music. They helped boost me into the industry. For me, the razzmatazz is all about fresh starts. Its about opportunities that I could never imagine.`

      transcript: `Spanish music, such a simple concept, but so hard to get right. How can you encapsulate an entire nation with a beat or lyrics. I didn’t think it was possible until I came to this dance club. This is the best place to feel and hear Barcelona.`
