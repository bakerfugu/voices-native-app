      transcript: `This is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.The line to enter Barcelona’s most famous cathedral often stretches around the block. La Sagrada Familia designed by Antoni Gaudi draws so many people to see it that the neighborhood is congested with tour buses and taxis and scooters. Some 3 million people went inside the church in 2016 and another 7 million came just to stare at the outside of this strange behemoth structure. “If you travel around Spain, you’ll see a lot of old gothic churches,” producer Katie Mingle was in Spain earlier this year, “but this one is different. First, it doesn’t look like a gothic cathedral. It looks like it was built out of bones, or sand, or like it just twirled out of the sea, like a fractal. It looks organic somehow.”  But there’s another thing that sets it apart from your average, old, gothic cathedral. It isn’t actually old. Gaudi wasn’t able to build very much of it before he died in 1926. Most of the church has been built in the last 40 years and it still isn’t finished.Which means that architects have had to figure out, and still are figuring out how Gaudi wanted the church to be built. “We are all together and our room is a special room. The most important part of the building we are building.” That’s Jeronimo Buxareu, one of the current architects of the building, and he says the clues to understanding how to move forward on the construction of La Sagrada Familia are kept in the room we’re standing in right now, in the basement of the church.`,

      transcript: `I have a confession. I don’t like Gaudi’s architecture. I remember the first time I traveled to Europe; it was New Years Eve 2002.  I was a sophomore student in college and was headed to Spain to see first hand the architecture I read so much about in the architecture magazines and textbooks.  Going to Europe was such an abstract thing for me.  Up to that point I only saw it as the “old world”, the other side of the globe, so random and blurred to me.

      While in Spain, I got exposed to this strange atmosphere that with all honesty, it quite intrigued me.  Out of all the places I visited in Spain, one made a huge impression on me –La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.  Maybe it was its “work in progress” character, or its grandiose status, or how the light created a ghostly but beautiful space; but this church was… well… unfinished sacredness.
      
      I’m not a fan of Antoni Gaudi –Sagrada Familia’s architect– nor I design anything close to his Gothic/Art Nouveau style, but Sagrada Familia gave me some “illumination” (and it was not the preaching).  For me, this was the first “recognizable” building of a famous architect I had ever seen and experienced in person.  Also, seeing this building as an unfinished “masterpiece” gave me the chance to see the complex and labor intensive process of creation; how something goes from idea to reality, how a space can change its character as it gets built.  Sometimes this is more interesting than the finished piece.

        transcript: `Though most people credit Gaudi with the building of La Sagrada Familia, one thing that a lot of people don’t know is that Guadi wasn’t actually the only architect working on the project. Though Gaudi’s efforts and contributions to the project are well-known, he wasn’t the one and and only architect who supervised the building. The former architecture started since the very beginning in 1882 was in fact Francisco del Paulo del Vilar, who planned Sagrada Familia as a regular neocathilic cathedral. However, Vilar resigned soon and in 1882, Gaudi took over the job, changing completely it’s designs. `,

        transcript: `You can’t appreciate La Sagrada Familia without appreciating the architect behind the work. Antoni Gaudi brought Catalan architecture to worldwide fame and reputation. Gaudi was also an architect and designer with a special ability to synthesize his own tradition and the courage to take on new technical solutions. He understood how to integrate creative and plastic elements in his buildings.  `,

        transcript: `La Sagrada Familia teaches us the magic of a work in progress. How is it that a building that started construction in 1882 is still unfinished?  Money, politics, controversy, bad timing, you name it… And still, it is not expected to be finished until 2030.  Good luck with that deadline…I was marveled by the “scene” created by this building.  By how the space changes day by day, piece by piece.  By how thousand of people visit it to literally see a construction site that is not so different from the hundreds of thousands of constructions sites around the world.  But of course, the historical baggage, the tragic death of its architect (killed by a tram more than 80 years ago), and the huge controversy heightens the public’s interest.  Who said we don’t like drama?I learned so much by just looking at this “work in progress”, not because it teaches any important life lesson, but because it opened my eyes to something new, something strange to me. Believe it or not, in part, this building inspired me to travel.
        For some reason – call it divine intervention or just mundane desire – at that point I realized there is SO much more to see throughout the world that I’m missing. Sagrada Familia made me want to see more of what’s out there on the world; buildings, cities, natural features, cultures, wildlife, etc.  I want to “build” something out of them, some significance, some knowledge, something I can marvel at.`,

        transcript: `Have you heard about the ghosts of La Sagrada Familia?You probably haven’t, but I’m going to tell you about them today. The ghosts of La Sagrada Familia live in the underground crypt. They’re there pretty much all the time. I can tell you about a few of them. Meet Ghost number one. At the west entrance to the Basilica, I felt very dizzy. There was a male ghost who was standing next to me. He was strong, and stubborn. As soon as I felt him, my boyfriend asked me if I were dizzy because he was, too!  The ghost was trying to get through to both of us. Who was he? He told me he was a construction worker who died while working on the church. He said that he lived in the late 1800s and early 1900s when an accident took his life. I believe that he fell from up high. Meet ghost #2. At the entrance to the gift shop, another male ghost kept vying for my attention. He made me even more dizzy than the first ghost. It was just before I ascended the stairs with the group that he hit me with a wave of energy (ghosts are energy) and made me feel like my head was spinning! He told me that he was also working on the basilica as a stoneworker. He said that a stone had fallen and crushed the right side of his head, killing him. He was just 37 years old when he died and he awoke confused, so he stayed behind as a ghost. `,

        transcript: `Sagrada Família is the magnum opus (that is, “greatest work”) of Catalan architect Gaudi. It is a cathedral of enormous size, a floor plan of 300 by 200 feet, with a capacity of 9,000 and planned spires over 500 feet tall. Begun in 1926, it is still unfinished, with work continuing and planned completion perhaps by 2026. (You may see construction equipment inside the church.) Like all of Gaudi’s work, it is designed to imitate nature. Similar to Park Güell the columns which support the structure look like trees. Other features also imitate nature. Expect it to be packed with tourists, but don’t let that dissuade you. It is like no other enormous cathedral in the world and not to be missed when you visit Barcelona. `,
