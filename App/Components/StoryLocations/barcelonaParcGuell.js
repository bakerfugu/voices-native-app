      transcript: `Park Güell is a public park in Barcelona conceived by the Catalan architect Gaudi. It’s like no other park you’ve ever been to because of its surrealist shapes and psychedelic colors. Although the shapes and colors look “out of this world”, much is inspired by Gaudi’s fascination with nature and the natural world. Many of the columns are inspired directly by the shape and structure of the trees which surround them. Another amazing feature is the mosaics. Gaudi became famous for the technique, which involves using small pieces of chopped ceramics cemented together. It is called trencadís. Meaning ‘chopped’ in Catalan. Don’t miss the trencadís salamander that guards the staircase in the monumental area. It was originally meant to be  a housing development, but that never took off. Imagine having your house in a neighborhood that looks like this!`,
