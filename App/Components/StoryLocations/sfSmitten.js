        transcript: `Smitten ice cream isn’t just incredibly tasty— it is an engineering marvel! All of the ice cream is made with the patented ‘Brrr’ machine. The founder of Smitten worked with a team of 14 engineers to create the Brrr machine.  Using a combination of liquid nitrogen and double helical beaters, the Brr machine creates ice cream with the ideal texture, viscosity, and richness. 
        Although you can go to Smitten’s permanent locations in PacHeights, Hayes Valley, Santana Row, and Rockridge, Smitten started out as just the Brr machine on a radio flyer wagon. The founder Robyn Fisher made Smitten a household name, charting her wagon all over the iconic places of SF. Now you can order ice cream from Brrrristas that will be the smoothest, richest ice cream in the bay. I truly cannot live without the cookie dough ice cream with pretzels and chocolate chips. Go try some!`,

        transcript: `Some of my favorite times in SF that I can remember was this one time for national ice cream day my friend organized this whole ice cream tour around SF. We visited 4 or 5 ice cream stops. I can’t remember the first one but the other three were Smitten ice cream, which was absolutely delicious, then we went to Loving Cup in SF which is frozen yogurt but it is like Cold Stone version so that was really good. It was really sweet overall, but it was still really delicious. And then the last one we went to was the Baked Bear which was one of my favorites. After we had the ice cream we went right into China Town and Little Italy because it is right in the heart of it. So we were able to have this delicious food and walk around all across SF while having ice cream which is pretty much a perfect day in my opinion. The only downside was there are just so many hills in SF. So we got tired and had to get coffee to sustain us.`,
