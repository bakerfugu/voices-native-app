      transcript: `I'm glad you're checking out Crossroads. If you're interested in sustainable fashion through thrifting, San Francisco is a great place to be. Crossroads Trading is one of the many awesome thrift shops in San Francisco. Known for its high quality gently used current and vintage fashion, Crossroads always has fantastic finds. The last time I was at Crossroads I got a pair of black heels that I constantly get compliments on, and my the friend I was with got a super cute denim jacket. I highly recommend stepping into Crossroads and exploring all it has to offer. There are also locations in other cities and states in the US. Itâ€™s fun to see how resale fashion changes based on the quirks of your location!`
