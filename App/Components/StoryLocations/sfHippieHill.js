      transcript: `One of my favorite memories of San Francisco was at Hippie Hill, which has a bunch of swings that overlook San Francisco. You can see the entire bay. You have to go across the golden gate bridge to be able to access it and it is a 1 mile hike up. But once you get there, there are three or four different swings you can swing on. You can take so many different photos. There’s also a really cool tree you can climb up to get an even better view of the San Francisco Bay. `,

      transcript: `The culture of Hippie Hill. So many people always ask “what’s hippie hill?”, “what’s it like?’ Today I want to tell you a little bit about the culture of Hippie Hill. A little bit of a history lesson and a little bit of insight from today. Hippie Hill became popular during the 1970s. During this time of cultural openness, people embraced life at Hippie Hill through activities like playing live music, along with the open consumption of marijuana, LSD and other drugs.`,

      transcript: `Are you looking to learn about the history of Hippie HIll? You’ve come to the right place. Let me tell you a little bit about this legendary patch of grass located on the grounds of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. Hippie Hill is a public park that was originally inspired by the spacious Central Park in New York, but Golden Gate Park ended up bigger and with a lifestyle that showcases the local culture of San Francisco. You'll find the gently sloping lawn located east of the Golden Gate Park tennis courts, just off of Kezar Drive, overlooking the beautiful Sharon Meadow (recently renamed to Robin Williams meadow), with tall coastal redwoods, eucalyptus and pine trees flanking either side. For most of the year, Hippie Hill is an easily accessible part of the park, however, when 4/20 rolls around, this historic patch of grass turns into the Bay Area’s most well known and attended 4/20 event.`,
