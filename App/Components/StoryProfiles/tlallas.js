        transcript: `I'm glad you're checking out Crossroads. If you're interested in sustainable fashion through thrifting, San Francisco is a great place to be. Crossroads Trading is one of the many awesome thrift shops in San Francisco. Known for its high quality gently used current and vintage fashion, Crossroads always has fantastic finds. The last time I was at Crossroads I got a pair of black heels that I constantly get compliments on, and my the friend I was with got a super cute denim jacket. I highly recommend stepping into Crossroads and exploring all it has to offer. There are also locations in other cities and states in the US. It’s fun to see how resale fashion changes based on the quirks of your location!`

        transcript: `It is no secret that Barcelona has amazing nightlife. When you’re here at night you can follow the sound of music to world renowned clubs that famous DJs have played at. My personal favorite place to dance the night away is Razzmatazz.  You can lose track of time and have a ball there, but don’t show up before 1am because that is when the action really starts.`

        transcript: `2020 has been a hard year for everyone. During the shutdowns and closures, parc de la ciutadella has become an oasis for Barcelona’s locals. In normal times, the park is crowded with tourists exploring our beautiful city. But since the shutdowns, more locals than ever have come to enjoy spending time in the park. I personally like to sit by la Cascada and write. The serenity of the atmosphere allows me to create my best work.`,

            },
        transcript: `If you are an art and architecture buff like me, you might be interested in the making of La Cascada. All of the wonderful sculpture you see was not initially part of the fountain. It was actually part of a revamp designed to impress at the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exhibition. Designed by Josep Fontsere and allegedly also Antoni Gaudi, it was inspired loosely by Rome’s Trevi Fountain. You can see the greco-roman influence in both the marble sculpture work technique and in the subject choice. The fountain’s centerpiece, Venus standing on an open clam with arms overhead, is a triumphant and bold twist on the Birth of Venus motif, which was famously painted by Sandro Botticelli. `,

        transcript: `Teleferic barcelona has some of the best tapas you can find.  Like many restaurants in the city it opens for dinner around 8pm.  You cannot leave without trying the grilled octopus. It is to die for. This family owned and operated restaurant has made a name for itself worldwide. Teleferic also has locations in San Francisco and Palo Alto California— though I think the original Barcelona location is definitely the best! `
