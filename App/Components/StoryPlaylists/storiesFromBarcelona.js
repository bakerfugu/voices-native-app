        transcript: `This is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.The line to enter Barcelona’s most famous cathedral often stretches around the block. La Sagrada Familia designed by Antoni Gaudi draws so many people to see it that the neighborhood is congested with tour buses and taxis and scooters. Some 3 million people went inside the church in 2016 and another 7 million came just to stare at the outside of this strange behemoth structure. “If you travel around Spain, you’ll see a lot of old gothic churches,” producer Katie Mingle was in Spain earlier this year, “but this one is different. First, it doesn’t look like a gothic cathedral. It looks like it was built out of bones, or sand, or like it just twirled out of the sea, like a fractal. It looks organic somehow.”  But there’s another thing that sets it apart from your average, old, gothic cathedral. It isn’t actually old. Gaudi wasn’t able to build very much of it before he died in 1926. Most of the church has been built in the last 40 years and it still isn’t finished.Which means that architects have had to figure out, and still are figuring out how Gaudi wanted the church to be built. “We are all together and our room is a special room. The most important part of the building we are building.” That’s Jeronimo Buxareu, one of the current architects of the building, and he says the clues to understanding how to move forward on the construction of La Sagrada Familia are kept in the room we’re standing in right now, in the basement of the church.`,

        transcript: `It is no secret that Barcelona has amazing nightlife. When you’re here at night you can follow the sound of music to world renowned clubs that famous DJs have played at. My personal favorite place to dance the night away is Razzmatazz.  You can lose track of time and have a ball there, but don’t show up before 1am because that is when the action really starts.`

        transcript: `2020 has been a hard year for everyone. During the shutdowns and closures, parc de la ciutadella has become an oasis for Barcelona’s locals. In normal times, the park is crowded with tourists exploring our beautiful city. But since the shutdowns, more locals than ever have come to enjoy spending time in the park. I personally like to sit by la Cascada and write. The serenity of the atmosphere allows me to create my best work.`,

            },
        transcript: `If you are an art and architecture buff like me, you might be interested in the making of La Cascada. All of the wonderful sculpture you see was not initially part of the fountain. It was actually part of a revamp designed to impress at the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exhibition. Designed by Josep Fontsere and allegedly also Antoni Gaudi, it was inspired loosely by Rome’s Trevi Fountain. You can see the greco-roman influence in both the marble sculpture work technique and in the subject choice. The fountain’s centerpiece, Venus standing on an open clam with arms overhead, is a triumphant and bold twist on the Birth of Venus motif, which was famously painted by Sandro Botticelli. `,

        transcript: `Teleferic barcelona has some of the best tapas you can find.  Like many restaurants in the city it opens for dinner around 8pm.  You cannot leave without trying the grilled octopus. It is to die for. This family owned and operated restaurant has made a name for itself worldwide. Teleferic also has locations in San Francisco and Palo Alto California— though I think the original Barcelona location is definitely the best! `
