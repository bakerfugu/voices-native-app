      transcript: `I remember coming to Camp Nou with my dad for the European Cup. These matches were more exciting than Christmas morning. Barcelona tends to be a very chill place. But Camp Nou brings out the energy, excitement and pride of all. Camp Nou allows locals to press pause on their lives, even if it just for a couple of hours. But those hours are euphoric. `

      transcript: `My first job was working at Camp Nou on the weekend. While everyone was watching the games, I was working concessions. Even though I could see the game, I learned to hear it and feel it. I could hear the cheers with every goal and boos with every yellow card that the blind referee gave. I could feel the stadium shake as everyone jumped in excitement. `
