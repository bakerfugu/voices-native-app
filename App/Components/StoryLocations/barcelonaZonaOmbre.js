      transcript: `Zona d'Ombra is a superb wine bar (enoteca) in Barcelona, specializing in Catalan wines. But, a wine bar in Spain also serves food! Not surprisingly they’re known for their tapas. For fish lovers there are pickled sardines, anchovies, salmon tartare to name a few. There is also an amazing selection of Catalan sausages, hams, chorizo for meat lovers. And, a wealth of vegetarian options. You’ll find it hard to decide what not to take! Better yet, it won’t break your budget. The average bill for food is 15 Euro, but of course, wine is extra. Don’t worry. A glass can be under 3 euros, a bottle as low as 7. Enjoy! `,

      transcript: `I used to think that wine was wine. I didn’t see much of a difference between different types. They all kind of tasted like dirt. That was until I came here. Each bottle of wine has a history. It has a story to tell about where it came from. You dont typically see the effort put into winemaking. But the owners here know the stories and are super happy to tell them. `,

      transcript: `When I first walked in to the old quarter of Barcelona. And saw all these little pincho bars lining the streets and these beautiful old buildings with the winding streets of cobblestone. It just felt like one of my happy places. I absolutely love food and I love the idea of getting to try different foods and in fact. I actually will usually change my order at a restaurant if someone else at the table is getting the same thing as me even if I'm changing what I most preferred and If you're here, the only things that I can tell you are get lost and try as many things as possible. The first one I don't think is too hard because these streets are impossible to figure out where you are. But the second one you may find yourself daunted by something like the sardines or all of the olives if you happen to not be as into those but I promise. `,
