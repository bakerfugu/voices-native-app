      transcript: `Zona d'Ombra is a superb wine bar (enoteca) in Barcelona, specializing in Catalan wines. But, a wine bar in Spain also serves food! Not surprisingly they’re known for their tapas. For fish lovers there are pickled sardines, anchovies, salmon tartare to name a few. There is also an amazing selection of Catalan sausages, hams, chorizo for meat lovers. And, a wealth of vegetarian options. You’ll find it hard to decide what not to take! Better yet, it won’t break your budget. The average bill for food is 15 Euro, but of course, wine is extra. Don’t worry. A glass can be under 3 euros, a bottle as low as 7. Enjoy! `,

      transcript: `I used to think that wine was wine. I didn’t see much of a difference between different types. They all kind of tasted like dirt. That was until I came here. Each bottle of wine has a history. It has a story to tell about where it came from. You dont typically see the effort put into winemaking. But the owners here know the stories and are super happy to tell them. `,
