      transcript: `If you’re here in May you might get a chance to see or, if you plan right, to participate in Bay to Breakers. Bay to Breakers is a tradition that screams San Francisco! It has been going on for over 100 years.  This is a 12k like no other. People walk, jog, and dance from Embarcadero to Ocean Beach dressed in wacky costumes. You’ll see groups ranging from the whole game of thrones cast to pac men to donuts. It is a wonderful way to see how San Francisco celebrates life, individuality, and culture!`,
