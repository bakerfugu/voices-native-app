      transcript: `Teleferic barcelona has some of the best tapas you can find.  Like many restaurants in the city it opens for dinner around 8pm.  You cannot leave without trying the grilled octopus. It is to die for. This family owned and operated restaurant has made a name for itself worldwide. Teleferic also has locations in San Francisco and Palo Alto California— though I think the original Barcelona location is definitely the best! `

      transcript: `There are two locations of Teleferic. One in Barcelona and one in California. And let me tell you, the quality does not decrease when you’re in California. I go to business trips in the US and this restaurant always manages to remind me of home. Not only that, but it shows cutting-edge styles of budding chefs. If you want a taste of what Barcelona, you should definitely, definitely come here. `

      transcript: `When I first walked in to the old quarter of Barcelona. And saw all these little pincho bars lining the streets and these beautiful old buildings with the winding streets of cobblestone. It just felt like one of my happy places. I absolutely love food and I love the idea of getting to try different foods and in fact. I actually will usually change my order at a restaurant if someone else at the table is getting the same thing as me even if I'm changing what I most preferred and If you're here, the only things that I can tell you are get lost and try as many things as possible. The first one I don't think is too hard because these streets are impossible to figure out where you are. But the second one you may find yourself daunted by something like the sardines or all of the olives if you happen to not be as into those but I promise. `,
