      transcript: `Teleferic barcelona has some of the best tapas you can find.  Like many restaurants in the city it opens for dinner around 8pm.  You cannot leave without trying the grilled octopus. It is to die for. This family owned and operated restaurant has made a name for itself worldwide. Teleferic also has locations in San Francisco and Palo Alto Californiaâ€” though I think the original Barcelona location is definitely the best! `},
