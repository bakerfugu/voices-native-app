        transcript: `Some of my favorite times in SF that I can remember was this one time for national ice cream day my friend organized this whole ice cream tour around SF. We visited 4 or 5 ice cream stops. I can’t remember the first one but the other three were Smitten ice cream, which was absolutely delicious, then we went to Loving Cup in SF which is frozen yogurt but it is like Cold Stone version so that was really good. It was really sweet overall, but it was still really delicious. And then the last one we went to was the Baked Bear which was one of my favorites. After we had the ice cream we went right into China Town and Little Italy because it is right in the heart of it. So we were able to have this delicious food and walk around all across SF while having ice cream which is pretty much a perfect day in my opinion. The only downside was there are just so many hills in SF. So we got tired and had to get coffee to sustain us.`,

        transcript: `One of my favorite memories of San Francisco was at Hippie Hill, which has a bunch of swings that overlook San Francisco. You can see the entire bay. You have to go across the golden gate bridge to be able to access it and it is a 1 mile hike up. But once you get there, there are three or four different swings you can swing on. You can take so many different photos. There’s also a really cool tree you can climb up to get an even better view of the San Francisco Bay. `,
